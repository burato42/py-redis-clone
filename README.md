# "Build Your Own Redis" Challenge
This is a starting point for Python solutions to the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

This is the clone of the Redis. The guidance is provided by [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io)

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Running

The entry point for your Redis implementation is in `app/main.py`. 

1. Ensure you have `python (3.13)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented in
   `app/main.py`.

If you'd like to use a different version of Python, change the `buildpack` value
in `codecrafters.yml`.
